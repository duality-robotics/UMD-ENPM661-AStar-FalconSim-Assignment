# A* Path Planning on TurtleBot3 with FalconSim & ROS2

Welcome to **Project 03 - Phase 2** of ENPM661 Spring 2025. In this assignment, you will implement the A* algorithm for a differential-drive robot and simulate the results in a realistic warehouse environment using **FalconSim** and ROS2.

## üìÅ Project Structure

- `ROS2/`: Contains the ROS2 workspace with launch files and source code
- `Scenarios/AMRPathPlanning/`: FalconSim USD scenario and Python control script
- `Twins/`, `Work/`: Simulation-related data/configs
- `slides/`: PDF slides for classroom instruction
- `.gitignore`, `.gitattributes`: Standard project config

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements (Local Users)

| System Requirement | Minimum Spec            |
|--------------------|-------------------------|
| OS                 | Ubuntu 22.04            |
| GPU                | Nvidia GeForce 3050     |
| RAM                | 16 GB                   |

**Software Dependencies**:
- FalconSim 5.1 (Linux only)
- ROS2 Humble
- Colcon
- Falcon Account

---

## üì¶ Installation & Setup

### 1. Falcon Setup
- [Create a Falcon Account](https://falcon.duality.ai/auth/sign-up)
- [Download FalconSim for Ubuntu 5.1](https://falcon.duality.ai/secure/downloads)
```bash
cd ~/Downloads
sudo apt install ./FalconSim_Linux_Ubuntu22_v5.1.0216.deb
```

### 2. Install ROS2 Humble (If not already installed)
Follow [this guide](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation.html)
Then install colcon:
```bash
sudo apt install python3-colcon-common-extensions
```

### 3. Run FalconSim Once
```bash
cd ~/duality/falconsim/
./Falcon.sh
```
- Login and save credentials when prompted, then close FalconSim.

### 4. Clone This Repo & Setup ROS2 Workspace
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/AStarPlanningProject.git
cd AStarPlanningProject/ROS2/falcon_turtlebot3_project_ws
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
colcon build
source install/setup.bash
```

### 5. Update Launch File Paths
Edit:
```bash
ros_falcon_astar.launch.py
```
Edit ros_falcon_astar.launch.py:
- Update `cwd=` to your FalconSim install path (e.g., /home/username/duality/falconsim/)
- Update `scenario=` to the full path of `AMRPathPlanning.usda`

### 6. Launch Simulation
```bash
ros2 launch astar_falcon_planner ros_falcon_astar.launch.py \
    start_position:=[0.35,1.2,0.0] \
    end_position:=[5.5,1.50,0.0] \
    robot_radius:=0.220 \
    clearance:=0.025 \
    delta_time:=1.0 \
    wheel_radius:=0.033 \
    wheel_distance:=0.287 \
    rpms:=[50.0,100.0]
```

## Important Notes
- Set start pose in `Scenarios/AMRPathPlanning/AMRPathPlanning.usda` (around line 50)
- FalconSim uses centimeters (cm); ROS2 operates in meters (m) ‚Äî the conversion is handled automatically in `AMRPathPlanning.py`
- Ensure your grid map is defined in centimeters (cm) for better path resolution.
- You will implement A* in: `astar_falcon_planner/submodules/astar_planner.py`

## Learn About the Simulation Environment
[Falcon Docs & Videos (EDU login required)](https://falcon.duality.ai/secure/documentation/umd-enpm-661-astar-planning-project-videos)
This page includes:
- FalconSim onboarding for students
- Demo videos of scenario setup and outputs
- Sample commands and map guidance

## Final Checklist

1. Follow setup instructions for FalconSim & ROS2
2. Update launch file paths and uderstand the package structure
3. Successfully launch the scenario with a valid A* implementation of your own
4. Submit all deliverables correctly and on time

## Learning Outcomes
- Implement the A* path planning algorithm from scratch
- Integrate and control a robot in a realistic digital twin environment using ROS2
- Learn how to tune parameters for non-holonomic robot navigation
- Gain experience configuring and launching simulations using FalconSim
